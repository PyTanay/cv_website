                            <h1>Formic Acid Plant Design</h1>
                        </div>
                        <p>At GNFC Ltd. we already have Formic Acid plant and based on that we implemented a separate
                            production stream running in parallel with the current stream to tackle bottlenecks in the
                            current plant
                            and increase production using waste-gases from the existing plant. All the basic engineering
                            and most
                            process aspects of detailed engineering were carried out by us.<br><br>
                            We carried out material, mass and energy balance of the new plant and also the existing
                            plant.
                            Existing production stream was simulated with the help of Aspen Plus and HTRI (For HE
                            design) and based on
                            the limitation observed, new stream was designed to take care of increased production as
                            well as current
                            limitations. All the utilities like cooling water, Steam and Chilled brine networks were
                            designed.
                            Currently the project is under implementation stage.

                            <br><br>Being part of core process engineering team I got exposure to almost all process
                            engineering
                            aspects like process design, process modeling and simulation, process design of all unit
                            operations and
                            equipments (like distillation columns, heat exchangers, control valves, safety valves etc.),
                            datasheet
                            preparation, P&ID preparation and utility network design. Also I participated in HAZOP
                            study.

                        <p>Aniline plant was facing the issues of the disturbed product quality at higher loads and that
                            was causing
                            the bottleneck. The issue was refered to the technical services team and we simulated the
                            distillation
                            section and we identified two limiting constraints where identified. Two different
                            distillation columns
                            were having high flooding in separate regions and based on the steady state column
                            simulatons innovative
                            solutions were implemented in both columns.<br><br>These modification removed the bottleneck
                            and production
                            capacity was increased by 25% resultion in significant increase in profit without need of
                            much investment
                            for revamping the whole section. The modification suggested also earned our depatment an
                            award for the
                            innovative idea.<br><br>
                            As part of the core team I simulated the distillation section using Aspen Plus and all
                            exchangers using
                            HTRI to check the adequacy and pressure drop across them. All other peripheral equipments
                            like pumps,
                            control valves and safety valves were also checked.

                        <p>In TDI plant stream with extra energy was identified and it was suggested to utilize this
                            energy in heating
                            up another stream going as distillation column feed, resultiong in significant reduction in
                            the reboiler
                            heat duty.<br><br>
                            As part of this project I simulated both stream loop piping including all equipments
                            involved
                            to estimate
                            accurate pressure profile as heating up of the other stream was causing the two phase flow
                            in that stream
                            and for the given service two phase flow was not recommended. I designed new heat exchanger
                            for this
                            service. Being the speciality chemical properties of these chemicals were not available in
                            the simulators.
                            so rigorous property parameters' regressions were done to match the properites at all
                            temperature and
                            pressure and using this regressed properties new exchanger was designed.

                            Steam turbine efficiency and power calculations can also be done using this site. I have

                            sit-togather at once and whole budgeting exercise can be finished in quickly, as this
